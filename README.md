# PDF Outline Extractor (Round 1A)
A Python tool for extracting document outlines (headings structure) from PDF files with multilingual support, available as both a standalone script and a Docker container.
Extract structured outlines (H1, H2, H3) from PDF documents using font-size heuristics.

# Features
- Extracts headings (H1, H2, H3) from PDF documents

- Supports multiple languages including:
   1. English (en)
   2. Japanese (ja)
   3. Korean (ko)

- Detects language automatically based on character patterns

- Preserves document structure with page numbers

- Generates JSON output with document metadata

- Docker support for easy deployment


# Requirements
For Standalone Use:
- Python 3.6+

Dependencies listed in requirements.txt:
- pdfminer.six
- pdfplumber
- regex

For Docker Use:
- Docker installed on your system

# How it works
- Processes all PDFs inside `/app/input/`
- Outputs a structured JSON outline in `/app/output/`
- Detects headings based on font size and position

## Installation
Standalone Installation:
Clone the repository or download the files

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Docker Installation:
Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t pdf-extractor-multilingual .
```
Usage
Standalone Usage:
Place your PDF files in the /app/input directory (create it if it doesn't exist)

Run the docker Container:
```bash
docker run --rm -v %cd%/input:/app/input -v %cd%/output:/app/output pdf-extractor-multilingual
```
The tool will process all PDFs and save JSON outputs in ./output

Output Format
The tool generates JSON files with the following structure:
```bash
json
{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "outline": [
    {
      "level": "H1",
      "text": "Heading Text",
      "page": 1,
      "language": "en",
      "font_size": 14.5
    },
    ...
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "avg_font_size": 12.0,
    "total_pages": 10
  }
}
```
Configuration
You can modify the following constants in main.py:
```bash
INPUT_DIR: Directory where input PDFs are stored (default: /app/input)
OUTPUT_DIR: Directory where JSON output will be saved (default: /app/output)
```

## üîç How It Works

- **Language Detection**: Analyzes text character patterns to determine the document's primary language.
- **Font Analysis**: Calculates average font size to identify heading sizes relative to body text.
- **Heading Detection**: Applies language-specific heuristics to identify headings at different levels (H1‚ÄìH3).
- **Structure Extraction**: Groups consecutive words and identifies the document's structure.

## üê≥ Dockerfile Contents

The Docker image is built with the following configuration:

- Based on the official `python:3.9-slim` image
- Installs all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Copies the application code into the container
- Sets the working directory to `/app`
- Configures the entrypoint to run `main.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Works best with text-based PDFs (not scanned documents)
- Heading detection may not be perfect for complex layouts
- Language detection is based on character patterns and may not be 100% accurate
